**What's New in the 10th Edition**

There are hundreds of minor fixes and improvements throughout the 10th edition; too many to list individually. 

All [errata](https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/errata/errata.md) and [improvements](https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/errata/improvements.md) for the 9th edition (up to mid-September 2025) have been made to the 10th edition. After publishing the 10th edition, any errata and improvements for the 9th edition have been duplicated in both the 9th and 10th edition [errata and improvements](https://github.com/markjprice/cs14net10/blob/main/docs/errata/README.md).

The main new sections in *C# 14 and .NET 10 - Modern Cross-Platform Development*, 10th edition compared to the 9th edition can be found in this book's section on the [What's New in your .NET 10 books?](https://github.com/markjprice/markjprice/blob/main/articles/whats-new-in-net10-books.md#c-14-and-net-10---modern-cross-platform-development-fundamentals) page.
