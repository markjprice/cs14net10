# Introducing C# and .NET

> Thanks to **eddyyxxyy** in the book's Discord channel for asking a question that prompted this improvement item.

Throughout the book I introduce C# and .NET and how they are related, but this information is spread over multiple chapters. Readers who are completely new to the technologies might still have some questions like "if theres ways of building C# programs without .NET". In the next edition, I will start *Chapter 1* with a brief introduction of C# and .NET and how they are related, as shown in the following text and figure:

C# and .NET are closely related technologies. C# is a programming language that compiles to **Common Intermediate Language (CIL)** aka IL code. IL code can then be loaded by the **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** that is part of the .NET Runtime and **Just In Time (JIT)** compiled to native CPU instructions aka machine code that are executed by your computer. There are other languages like **Visual Basic .NET** and **F#** that can also be compiled to IL code, so they are alternatives to C# that can create .NET projects. 

![Architecture of .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/blob-assets/images/illustrations/swimlane-architecture-framework.svg)

You can build .NET projects without C#, but C# can only build projects for .NET. In theory, since C# is an open standard, someone could create a C# compiler that builds projects for other platforms, but in practice, no one has done this. 

If you are a C# programmer then you always build .NET projects. If you are a .NET programmer, then you most likely use C#, or you could use F# or Visual Basic. Despite Microsoft's support for multiple languages within the .NET ecosystem, including C#, F#, and Visual Basic, C# has maintained a dominant position. According to JetBrains' 2023 Developer Ecosystem survey, 99% of .NET developers use C#, while 7% use Visual Basic, and 3% use F#. While F# and Visual Basic have their dedicated user bases and specific use cases, C# remains the overwhelmingly preferred language among .NET developers.

# Page 15 - Listing and removing versions of .NET

> Thanks to [s3ba-b](https://github.com/s3ba-b) who raised this [issue on November 5, 2024](https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/issues/75).

In the first paragraph I wrote, ".NET runtime updates are compatible with a major version such as 8.x, and updated releases of the .NET SDK maintain the ability to build applications that target previous versions of the runtime, which enables the safe removal of older versions."

This could be clearer, so in the 10th edition*, I will write soemthing like: 

"All future versions of the .NET 10 runtime are compatible with its major version. For example, if a project targets `net10.0`, then you can upgrade the .NET runtime to future versions like `10.0.1`, `10.0.2`, and so on. In fact, you *must* upgrade the .NET runtime every month to maintain support."

"All future versions of the .NET SDK maintain the ability to build projects that target previous versions of the runtime. For example, if a project targets `net10.0` and you initially build it using .NET SDK `10.0.100`, then you can upgrade the .NET SDK to future bug fix versions like `10.0.101` or a major version like `11.0.100`, and that SDK can still build the project for the older targetted version. This means that you can safely remove all older versions of any .NET SDKs like `8.0.100`, `9.0.100`, or `10.0.100`, after you've installed a .NET SDK 11 or later. You will still be able to build all your old projects that target those older versions."

*It was too late to make this improvement in the 9th edition. 

# Page 20 - Compiling and running code using Visual Studio

> Thanks to Phil who sent an email on November 11, 2024, asking a question that prompted this improvement.

*Figure 1.5* shows the result of running the console app in Visual Studio, as shown in the following screenshot:
![Microsoft Visual Studio Debug Console in Windows Terminal](page-20-console-2.png)
*Figure 1.5*

A reader completed this section but their command window looked different, as shown in the following screenshot:
![Microsoft Visual Studio Debug Console by default](page-20-console-1.jpg)

Note that it would look more similar if the window was resized and the window was configured with different colors: black text on a white background instead of the opposite. 

> To change colors with this old command prompt app, click the top-left icon, and then in the menu, click **Properties**. You will see tabs to change **Colors**, **Font**, and so on.

You can also install and use alternative command prompts or terminals. For example, I installed **Windows Terminal** several years ago because it has several benefits:
- It makes it extra easy to change color schemes. For example, instead of the default white text on a black background, my publisher prefers black text on white background (at least in screenshots!) because they look better when printed in a book.
- It supports tabs so you can easily manage multiple active consoles simultaneously.
- It still uses the builtin `cmd.exe` so the output is the same as the default.

Since October 2022, Windows Terminal is the default in Windows 11 so you should not need to install it. But if you use an older version of Windows, then you can install Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store. 

> **More Information**: You can learn more about Windows Terminal at the following link: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-is-now-the-default-in-windows-11/.

In the next edition, I might add notes about this.

# Page 21 - Understanding the compiler-generated folders and files

In the next edition, I will add a paragraph highlighting that files that use `.g.` indicate that they are "generated" by the build process. You should never edit these files because they will just get recreated the next time you build. 

# Page 38 - Getting definitions of types and their members

> Thanks to **not_a_pigeon1277** in the book's Discord channel for documenting this improvement.

If you try to use the **Go To Definition** feature in VS Code and you get a `Request textDocument/definition failed.` error then disable the **Navigate to Source Link and And Embedded Sources** feature, as described in the following steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings** | **C#** | **Text Editor**.
2. Clear the **Navigate to Source Link and And Embedded Sources** check box, as shown in the following screenshot:

# Page 82 - Verbatim strings

> Thanks to **John Leitch** `johnleitch` in the book's Discord channel for suggesting this improvement on February 3, 2025.

In this section, I explain escape characters and how they are used in C# `string` values.

I wrote, "But what if you are storing the path to a file on Windows, and one of the folder names starts with a `T`, as shown in the following code?"
```cs
string filePath = "C:\televisions\sony\bravia.txt";
```

"The compiler will convert the `\t` into a tab character and you will get errors!"

I failed to point out that:
1. The `\s` is an invalid escape sequence so the compiler rejects it and you cannot build the project.
2. The `\b` is interpreted as an escape sequence meaning a Backspace. 

In the next edition, I will add a note explaining that any character after a slash `\` that is not recognized as a valid escape sequence will prevent the code from compiling, and I will add a table of escape sequences, similar to the following: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/strings/#string-escape-sequences. 

I will also mention the useful `""` sequence and that it is enabled with both `@`-prefixed and normal `string` literals. 

# Page 102 - What does new do?

> Thanks to **John Leitch** `johnleitch` in the book's Discord channel for suggesting this improvement on February 3, 2025.

In the last bullet I wrote, "bob has a value of `null` and 4 bytes of memory have been allocated in stack memory. No heap memory has been allocated for the object."

In the next edition, I will change this to say that the size of the reference is typically 4 bytes on a 32-bit system and 8 bytes on a 64-bit system, corresponding to the size of a memory pointer. I cover this in more detail in an online-only section here: https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/ch06-memory.md.

# Page 223 - Understanding the call stack

In Step 5, I wrote, "In the `CallStackExceptionHandling` console app project, add a reference to the `CallStackExceptionHandlingLib` class library project, as shown in the following markup:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="..\CallStackExceptionHandlingLib\CallStackExceptionHandlingLib.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

You can also see this in the solution project here:
https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/code/Chapter04/CallStackExceptionHandling/CallStackExceptionHandling.csproj

But some readers do the opposite, i.e. try to reference the console app in the class library project, or they try to edit a "generated" file instead of the proper project file. In the next edition, I will change the text to say, "In the `CallStackExceptionHandling.csproj` console app project file," and I will add a warning box below Step 5:

> **Warning!** Make sure that you add the project reference in the `CallStackExceptionHandling.csproj` file. Do not edit the `CallStackExceptionHandling.csproj.nuget.g.props` file because this is a file that is "generated" (that's what the ".g." in its name means). Every time you build the project this and other ".g." files are recreated so any changes will be lost. Also, do not add a project reference to the `CallStackExceptionHandling` console app project in the `CallStackExceptionHandlingLib.csproj` file. You can only reference class library projects. You cannot reference console app projects.

# Page 403 - Fixing dependencies

> Thanks to [P9avel](https://github.com/P9avel) who raised an issue in an email that prompted this improvement.

At the end of this section, I will add a new sub-section titled, *Version ranges*. This will cover the notation for version numbers and how to control version ranges. 

For example, if you specify a version number like `version="9.0.0"` it does not mean `9.0.0` only, it actually means `9.0.0` *or higher*, because NuGet assumes that future package versions will be backwards-compatible. 

When defining the end of a version range, `[` or `]` means inclusive, a `(` or `)` means exclusive. as shown in the following table:

Notation|Applied rule|Description
---|---|---
`1.0` or `[1.0,)`|x >= 1.0|Minimum version, inclusive
`[1.0]`|x == 1.0|Exact version match
`(,1.0]`|x <= 1.0|Maximum version, inclusive
`[1.0,2.0]`|1.0 <= x <= 2.0|Exact range, inclusive

For example, to limit the package version of `FluentAssertions` to a minimum of `7.0.0` and less than `8.0.0` so that you do not reference that paid version, you should use the following:
```xml
<PackageReference Include="FluentAssertions" Version="[7.0.0,8.0.0)" />
```

> **More Information**: A complete table of notations is available at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/package-versioning?tabs=semver20sort#version-ranges

# Page 438 - Examples of regular expressions

> Thanks to **rene** in the book's Discord channel for suggesting this improvement.

*Table 8.8* shows some examples of regular expressions with descriptions of their meaning. The last two entries are:

Expression|Meaning
---|---
`^d.g$`|The letter `d`, then any character, and then the letter `g`, so it would match both `dig` and `dog` or any single character between the `d` and `g`
`^d\.g$`|The letter `d`, then a dot `.`, and then the letter `g`, so it would match `d.g` only

**rene** suggested "adding `^d.+g$` and/or `^d.*g$` ... so it would match `dingdong`." 

I like that idea, so in the 10th edition I will add that example to the table.

# Page 439 - Splitting a complex comma-separated string

> Thanks to **Chip** who sent an email about this issue on December 13, 2024.

In Step 1, I wrote, "Add statements to store a complex comma-separated string variable", and in the code there is a statement to sets that variable to a CSV string, as shown in the following code:
```cs
string films = """
"Monsters, Inc.","I, Tonya","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"
""";
```

But at least one reader added extra spaces after the commas between the double-quoted movie titles, as shown in the following code:
```cs
string films = """
"Monsters, Inc.", "I, Tonya", "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"
extra spaces ----^ ----------^
```
Doing this means the variable contains comma-and-space-separated values instead of purely comma-separated values. The regular expression was written to process only literally CSV values with no whitespace. (There is no formal standard for CSV so different systems will have different ways of handling it. Many CSV processors reject data with extra whitespace as malformed input.)

In the next edition, I will add a warning note about this:

> **Warning!** Do not add extra spaces between the comma-separated values. The regular expression is written to handle generally-accepted valid CSV, not comma-and-space-separated values.

Alternatively, you could change the regular expression to handle comma-and-space-separated values, as shown in the following code:
```cs
[StringSyntax(StringSyntaxAttribute.Regex)]
private const string CommaSeparatorText =
  @"(?:^|,)\s*(?=[^\"]|(\")?)\"?\s*((?(1)(?:[^""]|\\"")*|[^,\"]*))\s*\"?(?=,|$)");
```

> **Warning!** The preceding regular expression was provided by a reader so treat it with caution.

# Page 467 - Good practice with collections

> Thanks to **rene** in the book's Discord channel for suggesting this improvement.

Before this final section in the *Storing multiple objects in collections* topic, I will add a summary table for collection types based on **rene**'s [initial document](../ch08-collections.md)

# Page 484 - Managing directories

> Thanks to a reader who raised this issue with Packt who then forwarded it on to me to answer.

"In the code for this section which creates a new folder, checks to see if it has been created, and then deletes the new folder I have encountered an:"
```
System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path 'C:\Users\john_\OneDrive\Documents\NewFolder' is denied.
```

"The program creates a new folder "NewFolder" in `C:\Users\john_\OneDrive\Documents` successfully but then fails to delete the `NewFolder` when a key is pressed and the exception then occurs due to access being denied. I've tried replacing `{Directory.Exists(newFolder)}` with `{Path.Exists(newFolder)}` with no difference in the resulting `IOException`.
 
My system is a Windows 11 PC kept up-to-date with recommended updates. I cannot understand why if the path is ok to create a new folder, why access is denied when trying to remove the new folder from the valid path. It may possible be a quirk with OneDrive taking over the management of the `Documents` folder in the `Users` directory, but I don't know enough about how it works. It's just a default system setup for me.

I'd be grateful to know if anyone else is experiencing the same problem with this code, and what a workaround might be."

Your speculation that the problem is caused by OneDrive is likely to be correct. As soon as a new directory is created in OneDrive, it triggers a synchronization. This would prevent the directory from being deleted until OneDrive stops scanning the directory for changed subdirectories and files. 

To confirm that OneDrive is causing the exception by locking the directory while it scans it, simply try a path that is outside OneDrive.

A similar issue is caused by some anti-virus software. For example, Avast has a monitor that activates as soon as a new directory or file is created and scans it for viruses. This can temporarily lock a newly created directory or file.

In the next edition, I will add a warning box to explain these potential issues to the reader.

# Page 488 - Controlling how you work with files

> Thanks to [Vlad Alexandru Meici](https://github.com/vladmeici) who raised an [issue in the 8th edition's GitHub repository on December 31, 2024](https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/issues/81) that prompted this improvement.

The `FileShare` enum type is described as:

- `FileShare`: This controls locks on a file to allow other processes the specified level of access, like `Read`.

In the 10th edition, I will improve the grammar of the sentence:

- `FileShare`: This controls locks on a file to allow other processes **to have** the specified level of access, like `Read`.

# Chapter 10 - Working with Data Using Entity Framework Core

> Thanks to [P9avel](https://github.com/P9avel) who raised an [issue in the book's GitHub repository on November 17, 2024](https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/issues/1) that prompted this improvement.

This chapter introduces EF Core and how to use it to query and manipulate data in a relational database like SQLite or SQL Server. All code examples are shown in a console app and use synchronous code. This is best for learning EF Core because it keeps the code as simple as possible and focussed on the topic covered, but once a reader needs to implement EF Core in a server-side project like an ASP.NET Core Web API project, it is important to use asynchronous code. 

In the next edition, I will add a new section at the end to highlight how to use tasks and the asynchronous methods to avoid thread exhaustion.

# Page 628 - Structuring projects

A reader asked, "In Chapter 12, you discussed structuring projects within a solution. I'm a bit confused about where the service, repository, and DTO types should be placed. Specifically, where should I place the IProductRepository, ProductRepository, IProductService, ProductService, and the corresponding DTOs? In traditional N-Layer architecture, repository types are typically found in the Data Access Layer, while service types are located in the Business Layer. Additionally, I've seen some discussions about DTOs being placed in either the Presentation Layer or the Application Layer. Could you provide some guidance on this?"

In my book, in this section, I currently only discuss the structure of projects in a solution. Your question extends that to the structure or architecture of the deployed artifacts. In the next edition, I will add a sub-section to discuss the differences.

For example, you mention "DTOs being placed in either the Presentation Layer or the Application Layer". But they are usually required in BOTH. Imagine the Presentation Layer (perhaps a Blazor Wasm or MAUI app) makes a request to the Application Layer (maybe a Web API service) for products that match some search criteria. The Application Layer needs to create instances of `ProductDTO` and then serialize them and send them to the Presentation Layer. The Presentation Layer then needs to deserialize those instances of `ProductDTO`. So both the Presentation Layer project and the Application Layer projects must reference the shared class library that defines the `ProductDTO`. But there is only one shared class library in the solution. You would not try to structure the projects in the solution to match one-to-one with the structure of the deployed architecture. I suspect that's what is missing in your understanding. The other pieces you mention tend to only exist in one layer so those can match in the project structure and deployed architecture.

Let’s break this down step-by-step to understand the differences between:

1. Logical Architectural Layer Diagram
2. Project Source Code Structure
3. Deployed Artifacts Diagram

I’ll illustrate this with an example of a Products Management vertical slice, where a user can add, update, retrieve, and delete products. Each of these perspectives shows different aspects of the application.

## 1. Logical Architectural Layer Diagram

This diagram shows conceptual layers in the architecture, emphasizing separation of concerns. It’s independent of physical deployment and focuses on the logical responsibilities of the system.

For our "Products Management" example, a common logical layer diagram might include:
```
Presentation Layer
  ↳ Handles user interactions (e.g., ASP.NET MVC Controllers, Blazor Components)
Business Logic Layer
  ↳ Implements domain-specific rules (e.g., ProductService)
Data Access Layer
  ↳ Interacts with the database (e.g., ProductRepository)
Database Layer
  ↳ Physical data storage (e.g., SQL Server)
```
Each layer is logically distinct. For instance:
- The Presentation Layer calls the Business Logic Layer (not directly the database).
- The Business Logic Layer performs business rules (e.g., validate the product’s name or price).
- The Data Access Layer abstracts the database operations, such as querying or persisting data.

Example Flow: A user clicks "Add Product" in the UI → sends data to the Business Logic Layer for validation → passes it to the Data Access Layer to insert into the Database.

## 2. Project Source Code Structure

This shows how the source code is organized in the project. It’s focused on how developers structure the codebase to align with logical layers.

For the Products Management slice, a typical structure might look like this:
```
/ProductsSolution
  /Products.Web          → Presentation Layer (e.g., Controllers, Views, Blazor Components)
  /Products.Services     → Business Logic Layer (e.g., `ProductService.cs`)
  /Products.Data         → Data Access Layer (e.g., `ProductRepository.cs`, DbContext)
  /Products.Tests        → Unit/Integration Tests
```
Here, the code is divided into projects that reflect logical layers, helping developers work modularly. For instance:
- `Products.Web` contains ASP.NET MVC controllers (like `ProductsController.cs`) or Razor pages.
- `Products.Services` contains services implementing business logic (like `ProductService.cs`).
- `Products.Data` contains the database access code (like `ProductRepository.cs` or EF Core DbContext).

## 3. Deployed Artifacts Diagram

This diagram describes how and where the artifacts (compiled assemblies, services, or packages) are deployed in a runtime environment. It’s focused on the physical or logical deployment topology and runtime components.

For our Products Management example, let’s assume this is a web application with a backend API and a database. The deployment might look like this:
```markdown
- Frontend Web Server (e.g., IIS or Azure App Service)
    - Deployed: Presentation Layer artifacts (e.g., `Products.Web.dll` or a Blazor WASM app)
- Backend Application Server
    - Deployed: Business Logic and Data Access artifacts (e.g., `Products.Services.dll` and `Products.Data.dll`)
- Database Server (e.g., SQL Server or Azure SQL)
    - Deployed: The database (e.g., `ProductsDB`)
```
Here, we’re concerned about where the compiled code (DLLs, executables, etc.) and data reside during deployment:
- The frontend artifacts handle user interactions and API requests.
- The backend artifacts host business logic and database interactions.
- The database server stores data like product details.

## Comparison of the Three Perspectives

Perspective|Focus|Example for Products Management
---|---|---
**Logical Architectural Layers**|Conceptual layers (e.g., Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access)|Business Logic Layer validates the product; Data Access Layer interacts with DB
**Project Source Code Structure**|Organization of source code (e.g., folders/projects in a solution)|Separate projects: `Products.Web`, `Products.Services`, `Products.Data`
**Deployed Artifacts Diagram**|Deployment/runtime topology (e.g., physical servers, cloud services)|`Products.Web.dll` on web server, `Products.Data.dll` on backend, SQL DB

Here’s how a typical *Add Product* use case fits into these perspectives:

- **Logical Architectural Layers**:
   1. Presentation Layer: `ProductsController.AddProduct(ProductDto)` receives the HTTP POST request.
   2. Business Logic Layer: `ProductService.AddProduct()` validates the product (e.g., price > 0, name is unique).
   3. Data Access Layer: `ProductRepository.InsertProduct()` saves the product to the database.
- **Project Source Code Structure**:
   1. `/Products.Web`: Contains `ProductsController` and views or API endpoints.
   2. `/Products.Services`: Contains `ProductService` with validation logic.
   3. `/Products.Data`: Contains `ProductRepository` and EF Core DbContext.
- **Deployed Artifacts Diagram**:
   1. Frontend Web Server: Hosts the UI (Blazor app or ASP.NET MVC) and API endpoints.
   2. Backend App Server: Hosts `Products.Services.dll` and `Products.Data.dll`.
   3. Database Server: Hosts the SQL database storing product information.

By thinking in these layers and diagrams, you separate conceptual design (logical layers), runtime deployment (artifacts), and developer organization (source structure). It’s this separation that ensures clarity, maintainability, and scalability in software architecture.

## Where do DTOs fit?

**DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** are a crucial part of many architectures, but their role can sometimes feel a little ambiguous because they don’t belong neatly to a single logical layer. Instead, they typically facilitate communication between layers, especially when crossing boundaries like between the Presentation Layer and Business Logic Layer.

DTOs are plain objects used to transfer data across application boundaries (e.g., from the frontend to the backend or between layers within the backend). They are simplified representations of data that:
- Contain no behavior (e.g., no business logic or methods).
- Avoid exposing implementation details of other layers (e.g., no direct database entities).
- Are tailored to specific use cases (e.g., a subset of fields for a particular API endpoint).

Business Logic Layer accepts DTOs as input or output from the Presentation Layer but operates on domain models internally. For example, the `ProductService.AddProduct(CreateProductDto dto)` method accepts a DTO and maps it to a domain entity (`Product`) for validation and business rules.

DTOs can be embedded in assemblies like `Products.Web.dll` (for client-server communication) or `Products.Services.dll` (for communication between the Presentation and Business Logic layers).

Alternatively, if multiple layers share DTOs, they might go into a separate shared project:
```markdown
ProductsSolution
  /Products.Shared
    /Dtos
      CreateProductDto.cs
      ProductDetailsDto.cs
  /Products.Web
    ProductsController.cs
  /Products.Services
    ProductService.cs
  /Products.Data
    ProductRepository.cs
```

This ensures clear separation of the DTOs and avoids coupling them too tightly to a specific layer.

# Page 752 - Creating data repositories with caching for entities

In Step 10, I wrote, "Implement the `Create` method, as shown in the following code:"
```cs
public async Task<Customer?> CreateAsync(Customer c)
{
  c.CustomerId = c.CustomerId.ToUpper(); // Normalize to uppercase.

  // Add to database using EF Core.
  EntityEntry<Customer> added =
    await _db.Customers.AddAsync(c);
  
  int affected = await _db.SaveChangesAsync();
  if (affected == 1)
  {
    // If saved to database then store in cache.
    await _cache.SetAsync(c.CustomerId, c);
    return c;
  }
  return null;
}
```

The return value of the EF Core `DbSet<Customer>.AddAsync` method is an `EntityEntry<Customer>`. The code stores this in a local vaariable named `added` but we do not do anything with it. We could simplify the code by not defining and setting the `added` variable, as shown in the following code:
```cs
public async Task<Customer?> CreateAsync(Customer c)
{
  c.CustomerId = c.CustomerId.ToUpper(); // Normalize to uppercase.

  // Add to database using EF Core.
  await _db.Customers.AddAsync(c);
  
  int affected = await _db.SaveChangesAsync();
  if (affected == 1)
  {
    // If saved to database then store in cache.
    await _cache.SetAsync(c.CustomerId, c);
    return c;
  }
  return null;
}
```

A reason you might want the local variable is to discover database-assigned values like an identifier. But the `Customers` table uses a five-character text value for its primary key column that must be supplied by client code before adding to the database so it's not necessary in this scenario.

But instead of the `Customers` table, if we were adding a new entity to the `Shippers` table which has an auto-incrementing integer primary key column (or any other database-assigned value like a GUID or calculated value), then you could use the local `added` variable to read that assigned value, as shown in the following code:
```cs
public async Task<Shipper?> CreateAsync(Shipper s)
{
  // Add to database using EF Core.
  EntityEntry<Shipper> added = await _db.Shippers.AddAsync(s);

  int affected = await _db.SaveChangesAsync();
  if (affected == 1)
  {
    // If saved to database then store in cache.
    await _cache.SetAsync(s.ShipperId, s);

    // You can also read any database-assigned values.
    int assignedShipperId = added.Entity.ShipperId;

    return s;
  }
  return null;
}

```

In the next edition, I will add some information about this, similar to the preceding explanation.

In Question 2, "What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?", in my suggested answer I wrote, "The `double` type contains a special value of `Infinity`. Instances of floating-point numbers can have the special values of `NaN` (not a number) or, in the case of dividing by `0`, either `PositiveInfinity` or `NegativeInfinity`."

In the next edition, I will add that those special values output as `8` and `-8`.
