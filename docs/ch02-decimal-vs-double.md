# `decimal` vs. `double`

The crux of the debate rests on three main pillars:

1.  **Rounding Errors Exist in Both:** `decimal` is not immune to rounding errors. The example `1D / 3D * 4.5D` resulting in `1.4999999999999999999999999998` is a perfect illustration of this. This demonstrates that simply using `decimal` does not eliminate the need to be mindful of precision.

2.  **Performance Matters:** A key takeaway is the significant performance difference. `double` operations are hardware-accelerated on modern CPUs, making them substantially faster than the software-based calculations required for `decimal`. For applications involving a high volume of floating-point calculations, such as in scientific computing, engineering simulations, and computer graphics (including CAD), this performance gap should be a consideration.

3.  **Practicality in Engineering:** For most engineering applications, the precision of `double` is more than sufficient. Where specific rounding is necessary, it should be handled explicitly. This pragmatic approach often outweighs the theoretical precision benefits of `decimal` in contexts where speed is paramount.

# Fundamental differences

It's helpful to understand the fundamental difference between the two types to appreciate why I made the general recommendation in my book:

* **`double` (Binary Floating-Point):** This type is based on powers of 2. It excels at representing numbers that can be precisely expressed in binary. However, it cannot accurately represent many numbers that are simple in our base-10 system, such as `0.1`. This leads to the kind of small, yet sometimes significant, rounding errors that are often cited as a reason to avoid it for financial calculations.
* **`decimal` (Decimal Floating-Point):** This type is based on powers of 10. This makes it ideal for representing numbers in a way that aligns with human monetary systems. It completely avoids representation errors for fractional numbers that can be expressed in base 10. The rounding errors that do occur, as shown in the example, happen due to division and recurring fractions, not the initial representation of the number.

# Which to choose?

Both `decimal` vs. `double` have their uses, but they are emphasizing different priorities.

* **My book's advice** to prefer `decimal` over `double` is a simplification aimed at preventing common errors by beginners, particularly in financial and monetary applications where base-10 accuracy is non-negotiable. For a beginner or in a general context, steering developers towards `decimal` for any scenario involving fractional numbers can be seen as "safer" advice to avoid the pitfalls of binary floating-point representation.

* **The alternative argument** is a more nuanced and performance-aware take, rooted in the practical realities of specific domains like engineering and graphics-intensive applications. In these fields, the sheer volume of calculations often makes the performance of `double` a necessity, and its precision is generally adequate.

# Summary

The key is for developers to understand the trade-offs between the two types and choose the one that best fits the specific requirements of their application, rather than following a one-size-fits-all rule.
