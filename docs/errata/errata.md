# Page 521 - Managing the Northwind sample database with SQLiteStudio, Page 628 - Creating the Northwind database

> Thanks to [Amar Jamal](https://github.com/amarjamal) for raising [this issue on November 4, 2025](https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/issues/80).

On page 521, in Step 6, I wrote, "You will see the 10 tables..." but there are only 8 tables. For many editions there were 10, but recently I simplified the script to only create 8 tables by removing the unneeded `Territories` and `EmployeeTerritories` tables. 

On page 628, I wrote, "The script for SQLite is a simplified version that only creates 10 tables..." Again, this should be 8 tables.
